# endless-sky-thrower
Endless Sky Launcher made with GTK

The name is a joke, since it's a, you know, _launcher_

# Features
- Multiple installations
    - Continuous builds (Fresh from the releases section)
    - Stable builds (If you don't want to install a potentially unstable release)
    - Custom builds (Just point to the executable and voil√†)
- These installations can have optional requirements:
    - Vanilla (Won't get polluted with plugins)
    - Autoupdate (Only available for Continuous instances, automatically downloads the build everytime the launcher is opened)

- Plugin installer and uninstaller

# Compilation
Install the dependencies: 
- Arch: ```sudo pacman -S curl gtkmm3```
- Ubuntu/Debian: ```sudo apt install libgkmm-3.0-dev curl```

Then, just run ```make```
# Support
This application downloads and installs endless sky instances for you. Moreover, you can add custom instances that are already downloaded on your disk (For example: a PR, a content update...).
# Wanted:
Someone who can try to compile this to macOS (And test it, of course)
