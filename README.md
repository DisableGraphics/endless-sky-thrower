# endless-sky-thrower
Endless Sky Launcher made with GTKMM

The name is a joke, since it's, you know, a _launcher_

# Features
- Multiple installations
    - Continuous builds (Fresh from the releases section)
    - Stable builds (If you don't want to install a potentially unstable release)
    - Custom builds (Just point to the executable and voil√†)
    - PRs (Write the PR number and ESThrower will compile and setup it for you)
- These installations can have optional requirements:
    - Vanilla (Won't get polluted with plugins)
    - Autoupdate (Only available for Continuous instances, automatically downloads the build everytime the launcher is opened)

- Plugin installer and uninstaller
- Changelog viewer
